        //  second statement, if the first statement returns true, we take the path constant, and then we check the contents inside of the file.
        
        // NSArray has a method that we can use to get the data out of our file and put it into an array with which we can work.
        
        //Typically, plists come in two types: an array or a dictionary. Currently, neither the standard Swift array nor dictionary gives us a method that allows us to get data out of a file, so we need to utilize NSArray (as we are here) or NSDictionary, respectively, to do that.

        //This statement now checks to verify that we are, indeed, working with an array, and then returns true if so. If both conditions return true, our array inside of our plist is given to us. The array is set to our constant items.
